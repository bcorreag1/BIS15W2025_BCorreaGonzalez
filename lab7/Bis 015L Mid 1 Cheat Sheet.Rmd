Good Luck!
(Lets hope everything we need is in this document)

## Using Objects

-   An object can be defined as a variable such as X.
-   look at lab 2.1 if still confused.

x <- 5 .
This is the same thing as saying "x gets 5" or X == 5.

BUT DO NOT USE = as its basic and not used.

x .
This "prints" the object.
Doing so will just show whatever it is getting.

x + y .
you can add objects together or subtract or divide or do whatver you want with them.
anything can "get" can a value.
its also how we assign data sets.

### Nomenclature is important, including order of operations.

-   look at lab 2.1
-   we dont want to use names for objects that will confuse R. R has embedded functions that can contradict the objects you are assigning.

we can use 'c' for concatenence which essentially helps us assign a list.

for example if we want the mean of 3 numbers we can do mean(c(31,24,55))

### Classes of Data

There are 4 classes of data: logical, numeric, integer, and character.

to check what class type and object is we can use: class() is. or as.

functions allow us to clarify or change the class of an object

is.integer() # is my object an integer?

as.integer() # set my object as integer.

To define a numerical vector my_vector <- c(10, 20, 30) my_vector_sequence <- c(1:100).
This is used to define a range.

To define a character vector days_of_the_week \<- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thrusday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")

#### Identifying vector elements

We can use `[]` to pull out elements in a vector.
We just need to specify their position in the vector; i.e. day 3 is Wednesday.

days_of_the_week[3] my_vector_sequence[10]

### Operators that can be used within vectors.

We can use operators such as <, >, ==, <==, etc.
Show all values in `my_vector_sequence` that are less than or equal to 10.

## Data Frames

The data frame is the most common way to organize data within R.
A data frame can store data of many different classes.
We usually don't build data frames in RStudio, but this example will show you how they are structured.

Sex <- c("male", "female", "male"). characters

Length <- c(3.2, 3.7, 3.4). numberical

Weight <- c(2.9, 4.0, 3.1). numerical

c(1,2,3): Creates a vector.

matrix(1:9, nrow=3): Creates a matrix.

list(a=1, b="text", c=TRUE): Creates a list.

data.frame([]=c(1,2,3), []=c("A","B","C")): Creates a dataframe.

### Functions to give basics of DF

head(df): View first 6 rows of a dataframe.

tail(df): View last 6 rows of a dataframe.

dim(df): Get dimensions (rows, columns) of a dataframe.

summary(df): Summarizes statistics of dataframe.

glimpse(df): gives a bit more than just a summary str(df): View structure of a dataframe.

distinct(df, []): get unique values from column

rename(df, new_name = old_name): rename a column

We can combine data frames together

### Dealing with Missing Data or NA's.

is.na(my_missing): gives a logical response

anyNA(my_missing): gives a logical response

drop_na(df): remove rows with NA values

replace_na(df, list([] = 0)): Replace NA calues with another value


### Using the Select Function

select([], []): Select specific columns.

select(starts_with("prefix")): Select columns starting with "prefix".

filter(df, col1 %in% c("A", "B", "C")): Keep rows where col1 is one of "A", "B", or "C".

select(ends_with("suffix")): Select columns ending with "suffix"

### Using the Filter Function

filter([] > 10): Select rows where col1 is greater than 10.

filter([] == "A"): Select rows where col1 is "A".

filter([] > 10 & [] < 5): Multiple conditions using AND.

filter(between(col1, 10, 20)): Keep rows where col1 is between 10 and 20.

filter(df, near(col1, 100, tol = 5)): Keep rows where col1 is close to 100 within a tolerance of 5.

[]= columns

### Aranging Data

arrange([])sort the dataframe by the column chose

arrange(desc[])). sort the df in descending order. can also (-)

arrange(desc(col1), col2): Sort by multiple columns in different orders.

### Mutating Columns

mutate(new_[] = []*2)): create a new column based of the given syntax

mutate(new_[] = if_else([] > 10, "High", "Low")): create a new column based on a if_else condition.

mutate(new_col = round(col1, 2)): Round values in a column.

mutate(df, new_col = case_when( col1 < 10 ~ "Low", col1 >= 10 & col1 < 20 ~ "Medium", TRUE ~ "High")): Categorize values conditionally.

Example:If greater than 10 then label as high, if else then label it as low.

### Stats of Df
summarize(df, mean_col = mean(col1, na.rm = TRUE)): Calculate mean while handling NA values.

summarize(df, n_unique = n_distinct(col1)): Count the number of unique values in a column.

count(df, col1, sort = TRUE): Count occurrences and sort by frequency.

count(df, col1, wt = col2): Weighted count based on another column.

df %>% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)): Get means for all numeric columns.

### Grouping Data

group_by([]): group by column

summarize(group_by([]), mean_column = mean([])): apply summary stats to groups
