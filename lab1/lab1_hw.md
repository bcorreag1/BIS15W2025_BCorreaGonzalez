## Instructions
Answer the following questions and/or complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push the final work to your repository. Your report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for any included code chunks to run.  

**1. Please join the [class discord](https://forms.gle/AHHXd3aobaAdkkFg9). Put your screen name below.** 
My screen name is BryanC.

**2. Please tell us why you are taking BIS 15L.**
I am taking Bis15L as it is a major requirement for the systems and synthetic biology major, although I am interested in learning more computational biology. 

**3. Do you have any coding experience? If yes, please tell us what languages you have coded in and your level of experience.**
I do have some coding experience with R studio through STA100 and STA101. I also have MATLAB experience from linear algebra, MAT22A.

**4. Navigate to my repository on GitHub. Notice that near the bottom there is a description of the repository. You want something like this on your repository! It is built by making edits to the `README.md` file using RMarkdown. Edit your repository's `README.md` file so that you have an informative description, including your email address. Be creative! You don't need to just copy mine. There are lots of examples online.**  


**5. Make sure that you have completed `dummy_push.Rmd`. This includes successful upload to your repository. Put the link to your repository below so we can check.**
